# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### \$ sudo cat /usr/bin/me

Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver, and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

Iâ€™m currently building and breaking software at Microsoft in the M365 team.

I was previously with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We were helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications when it changes.

Before that, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) â€“ where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I'm not programming the web, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna~~ ðŸ˜‰, I [write](https://musale.github.io/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.

Currently, I'm into interpreters, how programming languages work, and distributed systems.

### Projects I've Authored

I've authored or co-developed some open-source software projects. They now live on their own [projects page](https://musale.github.io/projects).
